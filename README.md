# COEN174-AERS
The Santa Clara University Alumni Office is requesting help in creating a system that can record activities of alumni in events that have been created by the Alumni Officeor spontaneously by one or more alumni. Alumni Office staff can enter formal university-sponsored events(e.g., SCU athletic events, classroom speaking opportunities, etc.) and alumni participants can check in to record their participation. Alumni-organized events (e.g., informal class reunions) can be created by alumni, but must be approved byan Alumni Office manager before they will appear to the whole alumni community. Reports must be provided to detail events, locations, number of participants, etc.

3. Git clone: git clone https://github.com/axperez/COEN174-AERS.git
4. In the COEN174-AERS directory, pip install the requirements.txt file (pip3 install -r requirements.txt)
5. Within COEN174-AERS, inside terminal, run 'python3 manage.py makemigrations'. Then run
'python manage.py migrate'. Then run 'python manage.py createsuperuser'. Fill out required fields. Finally, run 'python3 manage.py runserver'.
